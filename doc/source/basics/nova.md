# Nova - Compute Service
Nova is the OpenStack project that provides a way to provision compute instances (aka virtual servers).

It requires the following additional OpenStack services for basic function:

- Keystone: This provides identity and authentication for all OpenStack services.
- [Glance](./glance.md): This provides the compute image repository. All compute instances launch from glance images.
- [Neutron](./neutron.md): This is responsible for provisioning the virtual or physical networks that compute instances connect to on boot.

## How to use
- Horizon: The official web ui for the OpenStack Project.
- OpenStack Client: The official CLI for OpenStack Projects. You should use this as your CLI for most things, it includes not just nova commands but also commands for most of the projects in OpenStack.

```
$ openstack help server create
usage: openstack server create [-h] [-f {json,shell,table,value,yaml}]
                               [-c COLUMN] [--max-width <integer>]
                               [--fit-width] [--print-empty] [--noindent]
                               [--prefix PREFIX]
                               (--image <image> | --volume <volume>) --flavor
                               <flavor> [--security-group <security-group>]
...
Create a new server
positional arguments:
  <server-name>         New server name
optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --image <image>       Create server boot disk from this image (name or ID)
  --volume <volume>     Create server using this volume as the boot disk (name
                        or ID).
                        This option automatically creates a block device
                        mapping with a boot index of 0. On many hypervisors
                        (libvirt/kvm for example) this will be device vda. Do
                        not create a duplicate mapping using --block-device-
                        mapping for this volume.
  --flavor <flavor>     Create server with this flavor (name or ID)
  --security-group <security-group>
```

- Nova Client: For some very advanced features (or administrative commands) of nova you may need to use nova client. It is still supported, but the openstack cli is recommended.
